\section{Developed method: driven temporal point processes}\label{developed_method}

In the Hawkes processes model previously presented in Section~\ref{hawkes_processes}, the assumption is made that all the nodes might have an influence on all the other nodes, in addition of themselves.
Recall that in our application to electrophisiology, and in particular to M/EEG data, we would like to capture the potential influence of an external stimulus on the activation of a specific recurring pattern in the cortex, called \textit{atom}.
It is easy to understand in that case that the influence can only goes one way, from the stimulus process to the atom process.
Furthermore, the stimulus process is determinist as it is controlled by the experimentator and thus cannot be modeled as a classical temporal point process.
If we would like to implement such a model using \texttt{Tick}, similarly as the Figure~\ref{fig:tick_hawkes_model}, three of the four kernels would be set to the null function, as the assumption is made that the atom do not have a self-excitatory behaviour\footnote{More details on the assumptions made later in Section~\ref{hypotheses}.}, thus only leaving the kernel connecting the stimulus to the atom as a non-null function.

For those reasons, we derived a model from the Hawkes processes model, in which a determinist point process has a potential influence on a temporal point process.
By \say{having an influence on}, we mean that an event on the determinist point process increases the probability to have an event on the temporal point process.
We call this approach \textit{driven temporal point processes}, as the behaviour of a temporal point process might be driven, influenced, by a determinist point process.
