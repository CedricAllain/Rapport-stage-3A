\subsection{Simulation}

As mentioned before, the intensity for an atom $k$ modelled with a specific stimulus $p$ only depends on a baseline intensity that is fixed in time and on a term independent from the activations of the atom.
Thus, as $e_p$ is deterministic, at every time $t \in \intervalleFF{0}{T}$, $\lambda_{k,p}(t)$ takes a deterministic value.
As a result, it is possible to consider the temporal point process $z_k$ as an inhomogenous Poisson process, as its intensity function is deterministic and non-constant in time.
For those reasons, in order to simulate $z_k$ data, we simply use the one-dimensional nonhomogeneous Poisson process algorithm described in \citep{lewis1979simulation, chen2016thinning} and detailed in Algorithm~\ref{algo:1d_inhomogenous_pp}.

Starting from $s_0=0$, at each iteration the algorithm generates a new event candidate $s_{m+1}$ sampled from a homogeneous Poisson process of constant intensity $\bar{\lambda} \coloneqq \max_{0\leq t \leq T} \lambda(t)$.
This candidate is either accepted with probability $\lambda(s_{m+1})/\Bar{\lambda}$ or discarded.

Note that the self-excitatory behaviour and the multi-directional influence present in Hawkes processes model, but assumed to be non-existent in ours, make the simulation algorithm more complex, as mentioned in \citep{ogata1981lewis, chen2016thinning, bompaire2019machine}.
Thus, if the assumptions concerning these two behavioural characteristics are amended, the simulation algorithm must be changed accordingly.

\paragraph{Remark} Thanks to hypotheses \refeq{eq:m_in_between} and \refeq{eq:separated_timestamps}, it is easy to compute $\bar{\lambda}$:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:max_lambda}
    \bar{\lambda} = \max_{0\leq t \leq T} \lambda(t) = \mu + \kappa(m)
\end{equation}
Thus, it is easy to see that more events, atom's activation in our case, will be generated around times $t = t_i^{(p)} + m, i=1,\dots,n_p$ as the intensity is maximal at these points.
