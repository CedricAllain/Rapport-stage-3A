\section{Introduction}

This document is my research internship report, whose initial subject matter was to model the temporal dependencies between recurring patterns in electrophysiology, namely in data obtained by capturing electrical and magnetic activity of the brain.
However, this report will focus on modelling the temporal dependency between external stimuli and recurring patterns.
The general method is derived from Hawkes processes, a specific type of temporal point processes, but with a different approach that we called \textit{driven temporal point processes}.

First, we will rapidly describe the working environment of Inria and more specifically the Parietal team.
Then, the general problematic of the work presented in this report will be detailed.
Will follow some background on both data in electrophysiology and on signals decomposition via dictionary learning.
Finally, a presentation of the theory of point processes will be done, with a focus on temporal point processes, as it is the theoretical tool used in this work.
